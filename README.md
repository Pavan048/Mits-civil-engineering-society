# MIT Civil Engineering Society Website Template

## Overview
This website template was developed for the MIT Civil Engineering Society competition. It serves as a basic template for creating a website that provides information about the society and its activities. This template is built using HTML and CSS and can be easily customized to meet the specific needs and branding of the society.

## Structure
The website is organized with the following files:

- `home.html`: The homepage of the website.
- `events.html`: A page for listing upcoming events.
- `members.html`: A page for showcasing society members.
- `contact.html`: A contact page for users to get in touch.
- `done.html`: A confirmation page or placeholder for a completed action (e.g., form submission).
- `home.css`: The CSS file for styling the website.
- `images/`: This directory can contain any images or assets used in the website.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Customize the template:
   - Modify the HTML files (`home.html`, `events.html`, `members.html`, `contact.html`, etc.) to add your society's content.
   - Customize the `home.css` file to match your branding and design preferences.

3. Test the website locally:
   - Open the HTML files in a web browser to preview the changes.

4. Deploy the website:
   - To make the website accessible to others, you can host it on a web server of your choice. Popular options include GitHub Pages, Netlify, or other web hosting services.
